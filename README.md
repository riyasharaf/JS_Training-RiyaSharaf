Logic behind my javascript program is :

(i) First i have created calcAverage() function which calculates total marks of all the students and then calculates the average score.

(ii)Second i have created findMax() function which finds the student who scored the highest marks. I have implemented this function using for loop.

(iii)Similarly i have created findMin() function to find student with lowest marks. Its implementation is same as findMax() function.

(iv) Then i have created CalculateGrade() function that calculates the grade of students depending on the category of marks they have. Implemented this using switch case.

(v)After that i have created RetakeExam() function that displays the name of students who have scored less than 60 precent and have to retake the exam. implemented this using for loop and created an empty array and added name using array.push() method.

(vi)Lastly i have created FinalAnswer() function that calls all other function and displays the final answer.
